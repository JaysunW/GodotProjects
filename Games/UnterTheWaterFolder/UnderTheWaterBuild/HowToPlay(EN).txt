Just open the game with UnderWater0000.console.exe and if anything unusual happens ("Dead" is a normal message in the console) tell me xD have fun
and please send me the questionaire when you're done.

Hey ho, 

thanks for testing my game so I have an idea whether to continue working on it or try to put what I've learned into a better project.

I don't have a tutorial or something similar so here are the controls:

WASD / Arrow_keys = Movement
O = direct change to store
Q/E / Mouse Wheel = change tool
Z / Y = delete save

Some other info: 

The idea of the game is that you are a diver trying to get as deep as possible to the bottom of the earth.
On the way you have your trusty tools with you. 
	1. your laser, which only destroys non-living matter in order to get deeper and deeper.
	2. your knife to open shells, farm corals and weaken fish to catch them more easily with the net
	3. your net to catch fish. The weaker they are, the easier it will be to catch them.

Store: 
There you can save and set off for the sea again. To see more tools, use the green and red buttons on the right.

Goals that are not yet in the game, but are still there as an idea:
More creatures to catch, your own aquarium to build, an encyclopedia with achivements, small missions with tasks, treasures and boss fights (giant calamari, giant shark).


Thanks again for taking the time.
